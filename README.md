## 📌 Project Overview

A hands-on home lab that simulates real-world cyberattacks using **Atomic Red Team**, detects them using **Sysmon** and **Splunk**, writes **SPL detection rules**, and maps every detection to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**. This project replicates the exact workflow used by SOC analysts and threat detection engineers in enterprise environments.
